# MarsRoverResearchTool

A tool intended for use by researchers, this program runs from the command line and utilizes a NASA API dataset to display photos in browser from the researches input date of choice. The program allows the researcher to take notes on each individual opened photo before moving on to the next available photo for their selected date. The photos are opened as a new Chrome tab. 

Special Instructions: This project can be executed by opening the solution in Visual Studio and clicking Run. This program will not display photos if a date is chosen that contains no data, for example, a date older than the Rover's age, or a date where camera's malfunctioned and had no data available. The suggested date for testing is 2015-06-03.
